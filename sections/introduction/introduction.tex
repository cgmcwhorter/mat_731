\subsection{Disclaimer}

These notes were taken in Fall 2014 in a course taught by Professor Dan Zacharia. In some places, notation/material has been changed or added. Any errors in this text should be attributed to the typist -- Caleb McWhorter -- and not the instructor or any referenced text. 

\subsection{Assumptions}

Unless otherwise stated, all rings are assumed to be noncommutative. All rings are assumed to have unity. For ring homomorphisms $\varphi: R \rightarrow S$, it is assumed that $\varphi(1_R)=1_S$.
